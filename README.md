### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luka Penger, I'm a software and hardware developer from Slovenia. I enjoy my work and for me it is a way of life. It is creative, demanding and extremely rewarding and I'm able to meet and get together with friendly and intelligent people, who are part of the community.
